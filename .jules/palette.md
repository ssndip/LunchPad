## 2024-05-20 - Icon-only Buttons Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like Trash, Settings, LogOut, Lock) in the Kiosk and Manager UI rely heavily on visual context but lack accessible names, making them difficult for screen reader users and leaving desktop users without descriptive hover tooltips.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` (for screen readers) and `title` (for mouse hover tooltips) using localized strings to all icon-only buttons during component creation.
