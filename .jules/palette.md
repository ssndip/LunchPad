## 2024-05-19 - Accessible Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons without labels (like those using lucide-react icons exclusively) are completely opaque to screen readers, creating immediate accessibility blockers for core tasks (like settings, toggles, or destructive actions).
**Action:** Always verify that `<button>` tags without visible text include a descriptive `aria-label` attribute.
